        Description:
            does shit, does more shit. does a lot of shit.
            i could go on for days about how much shit it does

        Args:
            big_table: An open Bigtable Table instance.
            keys: A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row
                to fetch.
            other_silly_variable: Another optional variable, that has a much
                longer name than the other args, and which does nothing.

        Returns:
            A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
            fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
            example:

            {'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
             'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
             'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

            If a key from the keys argument is missing from the dictionary,
            then that row was not found in the table.

        Raises:
            None
